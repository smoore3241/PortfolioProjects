'''
Here in this python code I'm testing out how to best scrape bandcamp's website,
In order to find clean data regarding releases genres based on location.
I have not found a solution yet since a releases genre is not 
plainly displayed on bandcamp's launch pages for new releases based on location.
The genre of a release is stored in the tags section of a release's launch page.
So going forward I'm going to see if I'm able to scrape the metadata for Bandcamp to find a solution
Until then, enjoy a little code that allows you to grab different aspects of 
Bandcamp's new releases launch page for the United Kingdom

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_text = requests.get('https://bandcamp.com/tag/united-kingdom?tab=all_releases&s=date').text
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_text, 'lxml')

artwork = soup.find_all('div', class_ = 'art')
info = soup.find_all('div',class_ = 'info')
