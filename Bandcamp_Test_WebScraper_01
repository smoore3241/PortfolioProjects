'''
Here in this python code I'm testing out how to best scrape several Bandcamp location based launch pages...
in order to find clean data regarding musical releases genres based on location.
I have not found a solution yet since a release's genre is not...
plainly displayed on bandcamp's launch pages for new releases based on location.
The genre of a release is stored in the tags section of a release's launch page.
So going forward I'm going to see if I'm able to scrape the metadata for Bandcamp to find a solution
Until then, enjoy a little code that allows you to grab different aspects of 
Bandcamp's new releases launch page for the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Austalia and Spain.
